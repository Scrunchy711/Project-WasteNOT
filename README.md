# About
With 3D-printing becoming more prevalent, there is an increase in 3D printed plastic (PLA polylactic acid plastics) waste. Currently only 4% of plastics are recycled while the other 96% are incinerated due in large to recyclable waste contamination. To address the issue of a lack of proper handling for PLA wastes, the project team proposed WasteNOT, a decentralised PLA plastic recycler that provides users with a fuss-free experience with plastic recycling. The recycler is entirely automated, reducing the manual process of sorting, and shredding is conducted to produce plastic flakes that can be used for upcycled products. WasteNOT focuses on recycling plastics locally as opposed to a centralised recycling process. For example, the recycler will be placed in a local area such as SUTD campus to serve as a recycling point for the surrounding community as a start and there are future plans to place it at other publicly accessible locations, similar to recycling bins.
