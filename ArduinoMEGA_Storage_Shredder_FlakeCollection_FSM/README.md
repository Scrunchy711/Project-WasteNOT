# Storage_Shredder_FlakeCollecction MC
Using an Arduino Mega, 3 subsystems are controlled with a Finite State Machine Logic for autonomous operation. The 3 subsystems are 1) Storage Subsystem, 2) Shredder Subsystem and 3) Flake Collection Subsystem. The Storage Subsystem first checks the IR sensors on the full status of each compartement before opening its respective servo motor controlled rack and pinion doors. The Shredder Subsystem activates the shredder DC motor via electronic relay, and also recieves data inputs from Rpi which observes the shredder for any remaining objects and return a feedback on whether to continue the shredder process or terminate it once all objects have been shredded. The Flake Colelction Subsystem operates a stepper motor which rotates a turn table with respective coloured flake collection compartments mounted on it. This ensures that all the same coloured shredded PLA flakes can be seperated and collected properly.
